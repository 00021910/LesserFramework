# REPO OF LesserFramework

**LesserFramework** - handmade framework made by nerd(s). This is a handcrafted under-development framework that is capable of making SPA (planned, in-development), client-side routing (also in-development with SPA), 2 way data binding (in-development) and Custom Web Componends powered by Shadow DOM.

IN-PROCESS: Optimizing, Bug fixing, Rendering HTML files as SPA pages, 2 way binding.
TODOS: Easier File Accessing functions (?), Improved SPA Client Side Routing that is completely synchronized with browser history, Server-Side example demo (?)

(?) - Optionals.

## What can you do with it?
Create functional Web Components, data binding in these components, easy SPA  and etc. Feel free to contirbute. <br />

## For Contributors:
AT FIRST, INSTALL ALL DEPENDECIES USING: <br />
``npm i`` at project root folder.

Commands list (from ``Package.json`` file):

``  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"`` - Test command <br />
``  "watch": "webpack --watch" `` - Webpack watches over the files & rebuilds when files are changed <br />
``  "open": "webpack-dev-server --open" `` - Automatically dev-server opens in default browser <br />
``  "start": "webpack-dev-server" `` - Start the dev server <br />
``  "server": "nodemon SERVER.js" `` - Run Express-powered server demo (not ready yet) <br />
``  "build": "webpack" `` - Build all files using Webpack <br />

Do not own this whole thing without mentioning author(s).
Thanks for contirbuting, by the way.
